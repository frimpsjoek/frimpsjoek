# 👨‍🔬 Joseph Frimpong

**`Graduate Student in Computational Chemistry and Content Creator`**

I'm a graduate student at Wayne State University, specializing in computational chemistry. My journey involves diving deep into various aspects of chemistry, including Density Functional Theory (DFT), GW calculations, and exploring the intersection of programming languages like Python, Fortran, and C++. I'm also passionate about embedding device engineering, data science, and machine learning.

In addition to my academic pursuits, I share my knowledge and experiences through blogging and content creation, shedding light on complex topics in a simplified manner.
